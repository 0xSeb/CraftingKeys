#Crafting Keys - Simple better Crafting!
##Minecraft Forge Mod

Crafting Keys is a modification which adds a lot of new key bindings to minecraft to enable crafting simply using the keyboard. There are also speed ups for moving items to furnaces or brewing stands. Basically every vanilla gui is supported. In future, there will hopefully be a API, to use this mod with other guis (e.g. EnderIO), too. Let's see...

##Development Progress

The whole project had been refactored and is now almost ready to be release. But there are missing a few things:
- Better Log Output
- Implementing all vanilla guis
- Better, all new GUI

If you like my work, you are welcome to [donate](https://www.twitchalerts.com/donate/skate702germany)! Programming is even more fun with hot pizza or cold coffee.
Also, you can support the code directly with pull requests if you have a cool idea. Feedback is nice, too!
